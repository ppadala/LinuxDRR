Interposing Block Driver
------------------------

This driver provides virtual block devices named /dev/drr[a-h]. These virtual
devices need to backed up by a real device. Once backing device is set, based
on the credit values, the scheduler provides proportional sharing.

How to use
----------
insmod drr.ko                       # Insert the module
./mount.drrq /dev/drra /dev/sdb     # Set the backing device for drra
./mount.drrq /dev/drrb /dev/sdb     # Set the backing device for drrb
./ioparam /dev/drra 4               # Set weight for drra
./ioparam /dev/drrb 1               # Set weight for drrb

Run the test program to test the reads and writes
./test

More coming soon ...
